Before using scripts, you must read the article on how to work with scripts.

AnimalCollector.py collects ads about missing animals from any website or communities. The following variables are changed in the script: 
URL (4th line) - link to the site where information about missing animals will be obtained.
Interval (line 5) - the time after which the bot will collect information.
link (line 27) - the access key required to save advertisements on the server as a JSON structure. Not all sites have an access key!
